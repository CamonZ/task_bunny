defmodule TaskBunny.Job do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour module for implementing a TaskBunny job.

  TaskBunny job is an asynchronous background job whose execution request is
  enqueued to RabbitMQ and performed in a worker process.

      defmodule HelloJob do
        use TaskBunny.Job

        def perform(%{"name" => name}) do
          IO.puts "Hello " <> name

          :ok
        end
      end

      HelloJob.enqueue(%{"name" => "Cloud"})

  ## Failing

  TaskBunny treats the job as failed when...

  - the return value of perform is not `:ok` or `{:ok, something}`
  - the perform timed out
  - the perform raises an exception while being executed
  - the perform throws :exit signal while being executed.

  TaskBunny will retry the failed job later.

  ## Timeout

  In default, TaskBunny terminates the job when it takes more than 2 minutes.
  This helps you to avoid messages stuck in your queue.

  If your job is expected to take longer than 2 minutes or you want to terminate
  the job earlier, overwrite `timeout/0` function.

      defmodule SlowJob do
        use TaskBunny.Job

        def timeout, do: 300_000

        def perform(_) do
          slow_work()
          :ok
        end
      end

  # Retry

  In default, TaskBunny retries 10 times every five minutes for a failed job.
  You can change the behavior by overwriting `max_retry/0` and `retry_interval/1`.

  For example, if you want the job to be retried five times and gradually
  increase the inteval based on failed times, you can write the logic like
  the following.

      defmodule HttpSyncJob do
        def max_retry, do: 5

        def retry_interval(failed_count) do
          [1, 5, 10, 30, 60]
          |> Enum.map(&(&1 * 60_000))
          |> Enum.at(failed_count - 1, 1000)
        end

        ...
      end
