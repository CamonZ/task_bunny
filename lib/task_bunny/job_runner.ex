  @moduledoc """
  JobRunner wraps up job execution and provides you abilities:

  - invoking jobs concurrently (unblocking job execution)
  - handling a job crashing
  - handling timeout

  ## Signal

  Once the job has finished it sends a message with a tuple consisted with:

  - atom indicating message type: :job_finished
  - result: :ok or {:error, details}
  - meta: meta data for the job

  After sending the messsage, JobRunner shuts down all processes it started.
